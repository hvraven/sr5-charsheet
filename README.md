This is a XeTeX based reimplementation of character sheet for the 5th
Shadowrun edition. The goal is to have an implementation that looks as the
original character sheet, but can be easily changed to match the needs of
different character designs.

## Known issues / ToDo
* Title width in boxes should be calculated automatically
* Text should be aligned with the beginning of a line
